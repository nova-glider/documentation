## Who are we?

We are a team of creative and innovative students who are trying to build a CanSat that will deploy not one,
but two gliders mid-air. Both gliders will be equipped with a GPS module to navigate autonomously to a designated
landing zone. We will also build a live statistics dashboard to monitor the CanSat and gliders during the mission.

## What is a CanSat?

A CanSat is a small satellite-like device, typically the size of a soda can, designed for educational and experimental purposes. The CanSat project challenges teams to design, build, and launch these mini-satellites to complete specific missions, such as deploying sensors or gliders. Through this project, students gain hands-on experience in engineering, programming, and teamwork.

## How will we do it?

Our project involves designing and building a CanSat capable of deploying a glider during its descent. Both the CanSat and the glider will be equipped with communication modules to transmit data to a ground station in real time. All sensor readings—such as GPS coordinates, altitude, and environmental data—will be sent to a central database via a custom API. This API not only collects and stores the incoming data but also provides it to a live dashboard, where the information is displayed in clear, interactive graphs. This setup allows our team and viewers to monitor the mission's progress and performance as it happens.
